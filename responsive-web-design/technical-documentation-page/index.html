                <p>SVG is an XML language, similar to XHTML, which can be used to draw vector graphics. It can be used to create an image either by specifying all the lines and shapes necessary, by modifying already existing raster images, or by a combination of both. The image and its components can also be transformed, composited together, or filtered to change their appearance completely.</p>
                <p>SVG came about in 1999 after several competing formats had been submitted to the W3C and failed to be fully ratified. SVG is supported by all major browsers. A downside is loading SVG can be slow. SVG does offer benefits, some of which include having a DOM interface available for it, and not requiring third-party extensions. Whether or not to use it often depends on your specific use case.</p>
                <p>HTML provides elements for defining headers, paragraphs, tables, and so on. In much the same way SVG provides elements for circles, rectangles, and simple and complex curves. A simple SVG document consists of nothing more than the <code>&#x3C;svg&#x3E;</code> root element and several basic shapes that build a graphic together. In addition there is the <code>&#x3C;g&#x3E;</code> element, which is used to group several basic shapes together.</p>

                    <h2>Before you start</h2>
                </header>
                <p>There are a number of drawing applications available such as Inkscape which are free and use SVG as their native file format. However, this tutorial will rely on the trusty XML or text editor (your choice). The idea is to teach the internals of SVG to those who want to understand it, and that is best done by dirtying your hands with a bit of markup. You should note your final goal though. Not all SVG viewers are equal and so there is a good chance that something written for one app will not display exactly the same in another, because they support different levels of the SVG specification or another specification that you are using along with SVG (that is, JavaScript or CSS).</p>
                <p>Before starting you should have a basic understanding of XML or another markup language such as HTML. If you are not too familiar with XML, here are some guidelines to keep in mind:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>SVG elements and attributes should all be entered in the case shown here since XML is case-sensitive (unlike HTML).</li>
                        <li>Attribute values in SVG must be placed inside quotes, even if they are numbers.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <!-- Edit text to remove references to follow-up MDN docs -->
                <p>SVG is a huge specification. This tutorial attempts to cover the basics. Once you are familiar you should be able to use the Element Reference and the Interface Reference to find out anything else you need to know.</p>

                <header>
                    <h2>Positions</h2>
                </header>
                <p>In this article, we examine how Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) represents the positions and sizes of objects within a drawing context, including coordinate system and what a "pixel" measurement means in a scalable context.</p>
                <p>For all elements, SVG uses a coordinate system or grid system similar to the one used by canvas (and by a whole lot of other computer drawing routines). That is, the top left corner of the document is considered to be the point (0,0), or point of origin. Positions are then measured in pixels from the top left corner, with the positive x direction being to the right, and the positive y direction being to the bottom. Note that this is slightly different than the way you're taught to graph as a kid (y axis is flipped). However, this is the same way elements in HTML are positioned (By default, LTR documents are considered not the RTL documents which position X from right-to-left).</p>
                <p>The element</p>
                <div class="snip">
                    <pre><code><span class="tag">&#x3C;rect</span> <span class="attr">x</span>=<span class="val">&#x22;0&#x22;</span> <span class="attr">y</span>=<span class="val">&#x22;0&#x22;</span> <span class="attr">width</span>=<span class="val">&#x22;100&#x22;</span> <span class="attr">height</span>=<span class="val">&#x22;100&#x22;</span> <span class="tag">/&#x3E;</span></code></pre>
                </div>
                <p>defines a rectangle from the upper left corner, that spans from there 100px to the right and to the bottom.</p>
                <h3>What are pixels?</h3>
                <p>In the most basic case one pixel in an SVG document maps to one pixel on the output device (a.k.a. the screen). But SVG wouldn't have the "Scalable" in its name, if there weren't several possibilities to change this behavior. Much like absolute and relative font sizes in CSS, SVG defines absolute units (ones with a dimensional identifier like "pt" or "cm") and so-called user units, that lack that identifier and are plain numbers.</p>
                <p>Without further specification, one user unit equals one screen unit. To explicitly change this behavior, there are several possibilities in SVG. We start with the svg root element:</p>
                <div class="snip">
                    <pre><code><span class="tag">&#x3C;svg</span> <span class="attr">width</span>=<span class="val">&#x22;100&#x22;</span> <span class="attr">height</span>=<span class="val">&#x22;100&#x22;</span><span class="tag">&#x3E;</span></code></pre>
                </div>
                <p>The above element defines a simple SVG canvas with 100x100px. One user unit equals one screen unit.</p>
                <div class="snip">
                    <pre><code><span class="tag">&#x3C;svg</span> <span class="attr">width</span>=<span class="val">&#x22;200&#x22;</span> <span class="attr">height</span>=<span class="val">&#x22;200&#x22;</span> <span class="attr">viewBox</span>=<span class="val">&#x22;0 0 100 100&#x22;</span><span class="tag">&#x3E;</span></code></pre>
                </div>
                <p>The whole SVG canvas here is 200px by 200px in size. However, the viewBox attribute defines the portion of that canvas to display. These 200x200 pixels display an area that starts at user unit (0,0) and spans 100x100 user units to the right and to the bottom. This effectively zooms in on the 100x100 unit area and enlarges the image to double size.</p>
                <p>The current mapping (for a single element or the whole image) of user units to screen units is called user coordinate system. Apart from scaling the coordinate system can also be rotated, skewed and flipped. The default user coordinate system maps one user pixel to one device pixel. (However, the device may decide, what it understands as one pixel.) Lengths in the SVG file with specific dimensions, like "in" or "cm", are then calculated in a way that makes them appear 1:1 in the resulting image.</p>

            <section id="Basic_Shapes" class="main-section">
                <header>
                    <h2>Basic Shapes</h2>
                </header>
                <p>There are several basic shapes used for most SVG drawing. The purpose of these shapes is fairly obvious from their names. Some of the parameters that determine their position and size are given, but an element reference would probably contain more accurate and complete descriptions along with other properties that won't be covered in here. However, since they're used in most SVG documents, it's necessary to give them some sort of introduction.</p>
                <p>To insert a shape, you create an element in the document. Different elements correspond to different shapes and take different parameters to describe the size and position of those shapes. Some are slightly redundant in that they can be created by other shapes, but they're all there for your convenience and to keep your SVG documents as short and as readable as possible. All the basic shapes are shown in the image to the right. The code to generate that looks something like:</p>
                <h3>Rectangle</h3>
                <p>The <code>&#x3C;rect&#x3E;</code> element draws a rectangle on the screen. There are 6 basic attributes that control the position and shape of the rectangles on screen. The one on the right has its rx and ry parameters set, giving it rounded corners. If they're not set, they default to 0.</p>
                <div class="snip">
                    <pre><code><span class="tag">&#x3C;rect</span> <span class="attr">x</span>=<span class="val">&#x22;10&#x22;</span> <span class="attr">y</span>=<span class="val">&#x22;10&#x22;</span> <span class="attr">width</span>=<span class="val">&#x22;30&#x22;</span> <span class="attr">height</span>=<span class="val">&#x22;30&#x22;</span><span class="tag">/&#x3E;</span>

                <h3>Circle</h3>
                <p>The <code>&#x3C;circle&#x3E;</code> element draws a circle on the screen. It takes 3 basic parameters to determine the shape and size of the element.</p>
                <div class="snip">
                    <pre><code><span class="tag">&#x3C;circle</span> <span class="attr">cx</span>=<span class="val">&#x22;25&#x22;</span> <span class="attr">cy</span>=<span class="val">&#x22;75&#x22;</span> <span class="attr">r</span>=<span class="val">&#x22;20&#x22;</span><span class="tag">/&#x3E;</span></code></pre>

                <h3>Line</h3>
                <p>The <code>&#x3C;line&#x3E;</code> element takes the positions of two points as parameters and draws a straight line between them.</p>
                <div class="snip">
                    <pre><code><span class="tag">&#x3C;line</span> <span class="attr">x1</span>=<span class="val">&#x22;10&#x22;</span> <span class="attr">x2</span>=<span class="val">&#x22;50&#x22;</span> <span class="attr">y1</span>=<span class="val">&#x22;110&#x22;</span> <span class="attr">y2</span>=<span class="val">&#x22;150&#x22;</span><span class="tag">/&#x3E;</span></code></pre>
